# Face-Detection-Algo
This project was done with the “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.
I have used the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. It is primarily an object detection method where you train a cascade function through negative and positive images, after which it becomes able to detect objects in other photos. 

In our case, we want our model to detect faces. OpenCV comes with a trainer and a detector, so using the Haar Cascade classifier is relatively more comfortable with this library.
